        R"(Usage: dosbox [-fullscreen] [-startmapper] [-noautoexec] [-securemode]
[-user‚Äêconf] [-scaler scaler|-forcescaler scaler] [-conf configfile]
[-lang langfile] [-machine machinetype] [-socket socketnumber] [-c command]
[-exit] [-v, --version] [-h, --help] [NAME]
Options:
  -h, --help              Displays this message.
  -fullscreen             Start dosbox in fullscreen mode.
  -startmapper            Start the internal keymapper on startup of dosbox.
  -noautoexec             Skips the [autoexec] section of the loaded
                          configuration file.

  -securemode             Same as -noautoexec, but adds config.com -securemode
                          at the end of AUTOEXEC.BAT

  -userconf               Load the configuration file located in
                          ~/.config/dosbox. Can be combined with the -conf
                          option.

  -scaler <scaler>        Uses the graphical scaler specified by <scaler>.
  -forcescaler <scaler>   Similar to the -scaler parameter, but tries to force
                          usage of the specified scaler even if it might not
                          fit.

  -conf <configfile>      Start dosbox with the options specified in
                          <configfile>. Multiple configfiles can be present at
                          the commandline.

  -lang <langfile>        Start dosbox with the language specified in
                          <langfile>.

  -machine {hercules|cga|tandy|pcjr|ega|vgaonly|svga_s3|svga_et3000|
            svga_et4000|svga_paradise|vesa_nolfb|vesa_oldvbe}

                          Setup dosbox to emulate a specific type of machine.
                          The default value is 'svga_s3'. The machinetype has
                          influence on both the videocard and the available
                          soundcards.

  -socket <socketnumber>  Passes the socket number <socketnumber> to the
                          nullmodem emulation. See README for details.

  -c <command>            Runs the specified command before running file.
                          Multiple commands can be specified.

  -exit                   Dosbox will close itself when the DOS program
                          specified by file ends.

  -v, --version           Output version information and exit.
